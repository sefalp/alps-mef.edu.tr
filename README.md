DecisionTree Regression

  Ä°n this repository I include my codes written on Python to seperate dataset according to its optimal X and Y values. Decision tree uses entropy values for each point in data and choose most pure coordinates for X and Y. Thus the most optimum coordinates found and data seperated as successful as possible.
  This is also my 4.th grade engineering lesson's (Machine Learning) assignment. Thus repo includes assignment description and it's report for detailed information in it.
